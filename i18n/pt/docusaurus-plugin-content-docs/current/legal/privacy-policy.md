# Peacock Privacy Policy

## Scope

This policy applies to the following websites and products:

-   All routes starting with '/peacock' on backend.rdil.rocks.
-   Any content displayed on thepeacockproject.org
-   Data sent to us when using the Peacock Server.

## What data do we collect?

When you view any of the pages this policy covers, exactly which page, as well as your IP address, and the time gets logged by us. This practice is typical and used by most websites. This information is stored on our servers for a maximum of 72 hours.

When you log in, the following information may be logged (in which case it is stored for a maximum of 1 business week), or stored in our database for long term data retrieval/storage:

-   All details saved when you view the page (as outlined above) (logged)
-   Basic data about your Discord account (see Discord developer documentation for what information is returned when using OAuth 2)
-   Unless explicitly opted out of leaderboards, details of the events that are triggered during levels, as well as scoring details, are stored in our database.

## What do we use this data for?

We use this data for purposes including:

-   Verifying you are in the Discord server
-   Assigning roles based on ownership status in the Discord server
-   Keeping track of leaderboard positions and statistics, and for moderation of these leaderboards.

## Request deletion of your data

Please contact a project admin on Discord, or email me [at symbol] rdil [dot] rocks.

## Opting out where possible

The Peacock server has the built-in capability as of recently released versions to opt out of certain features that may collect personal information.

To opt out of leaderboard data being submitted to our servers, run the server once, then edit the generated `options.ini` file, setting the `leaderboardsOptOut` value to `true`. To opt out of update checking, run the server once, then edit the generated `options.ini` file, setting the `disableUpdateChecking` value to `true`.

## Responsible disclosure of data breaches

In the case that any data collected is ever leaked, we will try our best to notify the affected users. Please note that we may not be able to contact you if you leave the Discord server, disable Discord direct messages, or fail to check Discord when we inform you.

## Use of data by third parties

Our infrastructure makes use of third parties which may process or retain your data, the privacy policies of those services can be found at:
