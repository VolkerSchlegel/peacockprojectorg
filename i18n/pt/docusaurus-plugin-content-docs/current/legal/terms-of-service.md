title: Terms of Service
description: Peacock's Terms of Service and Use.
---

While we aren't exactly lawyers, we do have some terms and conditions that must be followed.

## Terms

"We", "Us", "Our", and "Peacock" shall mean The Peacock Project team. "You" shall mean the consumer.

## Binding

By using Peacock or any related services, you agree to these terms, as well as the terms set in the [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md).

## Access

We agree to provide access to Peacock for select game owners. We have the right to deny you access if you don't own the game, or we otherwise see fit, for any reason.

## Licensing

Peacock is under strict licensing. Unless otherwise stated (see the `LICENSE` and `THIRDPARTYNOTICES.txt` files), all contents are the sole property of The Peacock Project, and are proprietary. All rights to these materials are reserved.

## Donations

Since Peacock costs the team to build and keep going, anybody has the option to donate money to help fund the project. All donations are non-refundable. Donors may receive early access to some Peacock features that are not yet ready for public consumption. All materials provided to donors, unless otherwise stated, are confidential. Donors who do accidentally leak confidential information will be given a warning. If they do it again after being given a warning, their ability to access this content will be removed.

## Manipulation

Attempting to reverse engineer or otherwise disassemble/reassemble Peacock and/or its connected services is not permitted.

## Change

This policy may change at any time at our discretion. We will attempt to notify you of any changes, but in some cases, we may not be able to. The date this policy was last modified can be found at the bottom of this page.
