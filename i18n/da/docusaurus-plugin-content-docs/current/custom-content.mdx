## Plugins
<details>
<summary> Click to Expand </summary>

Besides Legacy Escalations Plugin, which was described earlier in the Escalations section, Peacock supports a broad variety of  server side mods (plugins). These include, but are not limited to:
* Kill Everyone Mode
  * All real NPC's marked as targets, can get Silent Assassin rating back after killing everyone.
  * Note: Very buggy for maps with 200+ targets, guns may jam randomly. You may need to start by melee killing people.
* Sarajevo Six
  * Bonus Missions otherwise only available in Hitman 2016 Playstation version.
  * Installation Instructions: https://rentry.org/H3_TS6
* Plugins to add otherwise unused weapons to the game
* Plugins to modify existing weapons and disguises.
* **How to Install Plugins**: Broadly speaking, to install plugins, go to ```#plugin-releases``` in the Peacock Discord and download a plugin you are interested in. Then, install it to your main Peacock install folder (```...Peacock-vx.x.x/Peacock-vx.x.x```). Be sure to check for any further instructions in the ```#plugin-releases``` channel for a given plugin, as certain plugins may require further installation steps or are incompatible with newer versions of Peacock.

**Note: Plugins are only a small portion of the Hitman modding scene. Many Hitman mods are done client-side and out of scope of Peacock.** Client-side mods are aggregated here: https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3
