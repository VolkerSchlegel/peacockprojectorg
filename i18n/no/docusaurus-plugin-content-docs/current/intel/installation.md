Here's how to get up and running with Peacock.

1. Join the Peacock Discord server (https://thepeacockproject.org/discord). You must have a 7 day or older Discord account to join.

2. Go to the `#downloads` channel in the above Discord server and download the latest Peacock build.

3. Extract (unzip) files. Running the files from within the zipped folder will not work.

4. Navigate to where you installed Peacock, and run the files `Start Server.cmd` and `PeacockPatcher.exe`.

    - Depending on how you installed Peacock, you may need to open two folders to find these files, [as shown in this example image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833505136290299935/991068578579107870/unknown.png).

    - Note: If you are playing on Hitman 3, you will have to repeat steps 2-3 each time Hitman 3 receives a new update (more info below, in the "When/ How to Update Peacock" section). And for any of the three supported Hitman games, you will need to repeat step 4 every time you launch the game. The game defaults back to the official servers otherwise.

5. Now open the game as normal.
