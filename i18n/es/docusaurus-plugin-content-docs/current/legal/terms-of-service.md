description: Peacock's Terms of Service.
---

While we aren't exactly lawyers, we do have some terms and conditions that must be followed.

## Terms

"We", "Us", "Our", and "Peacock" shall mean The Peacock Project team. "You" shall mean the consumer.

## Binding

By using Peacock or any related services, you agree to these terms, as well as the terms set in the [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

## Access

We agree to provide access to Peacock for select owners of the HITMAN series. We have the right to deny you access if you don't own the game, or if we decide to deny access for any reason.

## Licensing

Peacock is under strict licensing. Unless otherwise stated (see the `LICENSE` and `THIRDPARTYNOTICES.txt` files), all contents are the sole property of The Peacock Project, and are proprietary. All rights to these materials are reserved.

## Donations

Since Peacock costs the team to build and keep going, anybody has the option to donate money to help fund the project. All donations are non-refundable. Donors may receive early access to some Peacock features that are not yet ready for public consumption. All materials provided to donors, unless otherwise stated, are confidential. Donors who do accidentally leak confidential information will be given a warning. If the donor does it again after being given a warning, their ability to access this content will be removed. Donations are not required, but much appreciated.

## Manipulation

Engaging in or attempting to reverse engineer, modify (with some exceptions, see [plugins section](#plugins)), or otherwise disassemble/reassemble Peacock and/or its connected services is not permitted.

## Plugins

We encourage authorized users to create plugins to add, change, or remove functionality from Peacock. Plugin developers are allowed to modify Peacock through our internal plugin system, assuming modifications made do not violate any other rules laid out in this document. While the plugin system is an official feature of Peacock, unless otherwise stated, plugins are not provided by nor endorsed by The Peacock Project. We provide no liability, warranty, or support for these plugins. If you wish to become a plugin developer, and gain access to our official plugin development resources, contact an admin on Discord.

## Interpretation

All translations are provided purely for informational purposes. In case of discrepancy between the English text and any translations, the English version shall prevail.

## Change

This policy may change at any time at our discretion. We will attempt to notify you of any changes, but in some cases, we may not be able to. The date this policy was last modified can be found at the bottom of this page.
