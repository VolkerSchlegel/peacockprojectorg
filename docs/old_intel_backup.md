## Can I use this if I am not on PC?

No. Sadly, we haven't found a way to inject the required code into the game on console, Stadia, Switch, etc.
Peacock is PC only.

## What are the requirements for using this?

-   A non-pirated copy of the game, from one of the following stores:
    -   HITMAN™ from Steam
    -   HITMAN™ GOTY Edition from Epic Games
    -   HITMAN™ 2 from Steam
    -   HITMAN™ 3 from Epic Games
    -   HITMAN™ 3 from Steam
-   For the server:
    -   A platform supported by Node.js, meaning Windows 8.1 or up, or a recent Linux/macOS/FreeBSD installation.
    -   We have alternatives available if you are unable to meet these requirements, please ask in the Discord.
-   For the patcher:
    -   Windows 7 or up
-   You can run the server on any machine that supports the Node.js version that Peacock targets, but the patcher must be run on the same machine as the game.

## What can the server do?

It can:

-   Keep track of your rating (Silent Assassin, etc.)
-   Give you a rating screen on mission end
-   Let you play most of the official content (with other content available in plugin form)
-   Let you play content that isn't officially in the game anymore, such as Berlin Egg Hunt
-   Display leaderboards for other Peacock users
-   Play contracts, and download them from the official servers with ease (our contracts are simple files, you can modify them and share them with your friends!)
-   Give you all unlockables by default

## Why Peacock as the name?

Peacock is the name that the game uses in its source code for the mission "The Showstopper", which ushered in a new era of Hitman. Hence, Peacock sounds quite fitting.

## Unlockables?

Everything is unlocked by default.

## Can I save?

Yes, you can. Assuming the save was made while on Peacock (not on IOI servers or offline), you should be able to load it.

## Will this work for H2 or H2016?

Somewhat. We are still actively working on support for both games, and you can give it a try, but be warned: there may be bugs.

## Does this in any way affect my official servers profile?

Short answer, yes - in very minor ways.

Due to the fact that we have not properly implemented some minor features like content/story spoiler warnings, it will
change them all to the 'I have already played' state. Other than that, it shouldn't have any affect.
