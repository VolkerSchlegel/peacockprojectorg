## Can I use this if I am not on PC?

No. Sadly, we haven't found a way to inject the required code into the game on console, Stadia, Switch, etc.
Peacock is PC only.

## What can the server do?

It can:

-   Keep track of your rating (Silent Assassin, etc.)
-   Give you a rating screen on mission end
-   Let you play most of the official content (with other content available in plugin form)
-   Let you play content that isn't officially in the game anymore, such as Berlin Egg Hunt
-   Display leaderboards for other Peacock users
-   Play contracts, and download them from the official servers with ease (our contracts are simple files, you can modify them and share them with your friends!)
-   Give you all unlockables by default

## Why Peacock as the name?

Peacock is the name that the game uses in its source code for the mission "The Showstopper", which ushered in a new era of Hitman. Hence, Peacock sounds quite fitting.

## Unlockables?

Everything is unlocked by default.

## Can I save?

Yes, you can. Assuming the save was made while on Peacock (not on IOI servers or offline), you should be able to load it.
