## Can I use this if I am not on PC?

No. Sadly, there is no way to properly inject the required code into the game on console, Stadia, Switch, etc. This is PC only.

## What are the requirements for using this?

Just an non-pirated copy of the game for PC. This server does not support piracy. It also checks to ensure you own the required content whenever you try to play a level.

## What is the worst IOI can do to me for using this?

IOI can't take the game away from you (Steam/Epic). They can remove your profile/ban you from the official game servers, but so far, even people like Sprut are not banned, so this is highly unlikely.

## What can the server do?

See `#capabilities` on the Discord.

## Why Peacock as the name?

Peacock is the name that Hitman uses in its source code for the mission "The Showstopper", which stopped the show by ushering in a new era of Hitman. Hence, Peacock sounds quite fitting.

## Unlockables?

Everything is unlocked by default. We do not yet have challenges, but they are planned to be added soon.

On Peacock, you are able to play Holiday Hoarders and Hokkaido Snow Festival at any time if you own the legacy content access pass.

## Can I save?

Yes, you can. Assuming the save was made while on Peacock (not IOI servers or offline), you should be able to load it.

## Will this work for H2 or H2016?

Right now, no. We will not support Hitman 2. 2016 support will be coming soon though.
