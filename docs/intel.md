## Can I use this if I am not on PC?

No. Sadly, there is no way to inject the required code into the game on console, Stadia, Switch, etc.
Peacock is PC only.

## What are the requirements for using this?

Just a non-pirated copy of the game for PC.

## What can the server do?

It can:

-   Keep track of your rating (Silent Assassin, etc.)
-   Give you a rating screen on mission end
-   Let you play most of the official content, except for some escalations, which are in the process of being ported
-   Let you play content that isn't officially in the game anymore, such as Holiday Hoarders, Hokkaido Snow Festival, Berlin Egg Hunt, and the HITMAN™ 2 Halloween escalation
-   Display leaderboards for other Peacock users
-   Play contracts, and download them from the official servers with ease (our contracts are simple files, you can modify them and share them with your friends!)
-   Give you all unlockables by default (progression coming soon)

## Why Peacock as the name?

Peacock is the name that the game uses in its source code for the mission "The Showstopper", which ushered in a new era of Hitman. Hence, Peacock sounds quite fitting.

## Unlockables?

Everything is unlocked by default.

## Can I save?

Yes, you can. Assuming the save was made while on Peacock (not on IOI servers or offline), you should be able to load it.

## Will this work for H2 or H2016?

Right now, no.

We have no plans to support HITMAN™ 2.

HITMAN™ (2016) support will is in active development.

## Does this in any way affect my official servers profile?

Short answer, yes - in very minor ways.

Due to the fact that we have not properly implemented some minor features like content/story spoiler warnings, it will
change them all to the 'I have already played' state. Other than that, it shouldn't have any affect.
