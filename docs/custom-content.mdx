Peacock has lots of goodies packed in for our users.
Here's a peek at our custom content!

## Elusive Targets

Within Peacock, you can replay Elusive Targets without any time limit on restarts (unlike Elusive Target Arcade), and without a time limit.
  * How to Play: After starting up Hitman 3 in Peacock, go to ```Career``` -> ```Elusive Targets``` in-game.
  
## Escalations

* Peacock supports custom (made with user input) escalations. These escalations are available in-game by default. You can see some custom escalations listed in the [Roadmaps](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/roadmaps) as well.

* Peacock also supports some official server escalations, although not all are ported. These escalations are available in-game by default.
* Peacock supports Hitman 2016 escalations that have not been ported to Hitman 2 or 3 (legacy escalations).
  * To install legacy escalations, search ```legacy in: plugin-releases``` in the Peacock Discord. Download ```LegacyEscalationsPlugin.js```, install it to your main Peacock install folder (```...Peacock-vx.x.x/Peacock-vx.x.x```).
* How to Play: Go to ```Destinations``` menu in-game to play escalations.

## Contracts Mode

Peacock supports both official server and custom Peacock contracts.
  
* How to play featured contracts (includes all official servers featured contracts, as well as some custom contracts created by Peacock dev team): Go to ```Game Modes``` -> ```Contracts``` -> ```Featured``` menu in-game
* How to play user created official server contracts (may be buggy): Go to ```Game Modes``` -> ```Contracts``` -> ```Contract Lookup``` menu in-game. Enter the official server contract ID (note: only Steam and Epic Hitman 3 contracts are supported). The contract will now be downloaded in ```...Peacock-vx.x.x/Peacock-vx.x.x/Contracts/```.
* How to play user created Peacock contracts: Download the contracts ```.ocre``` file from the ```share-contracts``` channel in Peacock Discord. Install this ```.ocre``` file to your ```...Peacock-vx.x.x/Peacock-vx.x.x/Contracts``` folder. Now go ```Game Modes``` -> ```Contracts``` -> ```My Contracts``` in-game to play.
  * If you create a contract in-game while in Peacock server, your contract will be saved as an ```.ocre``` file in ```...Peacock-vx.x.x/Peacock-vx.x.x/Contracts``` folder. Be sure to share your ```.ocre``` file in Peacock Discord's ```share-contracts``` channel if you want others to play your custom Peacock contract.

## Plugin Mods

Besides Legacy Escalations Plugin, which was described earlier in the Escalations section, Peacock supports a broad variety of server-side mods (plugins). These plugins can be found in the ```#plugin-releases``` channel of Peacock Discord. These include, but are not limited to:
* Kill Everyone Mode (all real NPC's marked as targets, can get Silent Assassin rating back after killing everyone)
    * Note: Very buggy for maps with 200+ targets, guns may jam randomly. You may need to start by melee killing people.
* Sarajevo Six (Otherwise only available in Hitman 2016, Playstation version). 
  * Installation Instructions: https://rentry.org/H3_TS6
* Plugins to add otherwise unused weapons to the game
* Plugins to modify existing weapons and disguises.

**Note: Peacock Plugin Mods are only a small portion of the Hitman modding scene. Many Hitman mods are done client-side and out of scope of Peacock.** Client-side mods are aggregated here: https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3
