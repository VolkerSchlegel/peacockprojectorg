title: Terms of Service
description: Peacock's Terms of Service and Use.
---

While we aren't exactly lawyers, we do have some terms and conditions that must be followed.

## Terms

"We", "Us", and "Peacock" shall mean The Peacock Project team.
"You" shall mean the consumer.

## Binding

By using Peacock or any related services, you agree to these terms.

## Access

We agree to provide access to Peacock for select game owners.
We have the right to deny you access if you don't own the game, or we otherwise see fit, for any reason.

## Donations

Since Peacock costs the team to build and keep going, anybody has the option to donate money to help fund the project.
All donations are non-refundable.
Donors may receive early access to some Peacock features that are not yet ready for public consumption.
All materials provided to donors, unless otherwise stated, are confidential.

## Change

This policy may change at any time at our discretion. We will attempt to notify you of any changes, but in some cases, we may not be able to.
The date this policy was last modified can be found at the bottom of this page.
