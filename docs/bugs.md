# Bug Tracker

Welcome to the bug tracker. This lets us easily keep track of bugs that we know exist and _plan to fix_.

To report a bug, please see the `#bug-report` channel of our Discord.

## Contract Creation

-   Contract creation is still very much a work-in-progress, and has way too many bugs to list them all here.

## Missions

-   Mission stories don't display properly on the planning screen.

## General

-   It can take numerous tries to connect to the server.
-   Some bugged suits are present (7 deadly sins).

## Menus

-   The destinations menu displays all escalations at the end instead of attached to the relevant missions.

## Escalations

-   Escalation progress isn't always saved, or gets corrupted.
-   Custom escalations have brackets (`[` and `]`) in their names.
