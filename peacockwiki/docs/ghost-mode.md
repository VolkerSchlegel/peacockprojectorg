# Ghost Mode

The Peacock Project is happy to announce that we are running our own [LocalGhost](https://gitlab.com/grappigegovert/LocalGhost) server!

Ghost Mode for HITMAN 2 has returned as an unofficial game mode!
You and a friend can connect and invite each other to a friendly Ghost Mode match using Steam's invite system.

(_Matchmaking is not yet supported_).

Ghost Mode is available for PC players who own HITMAN 2 (legitimately).

## How to Connect

1. Download the LocalGhost Patcher from [here](https://gitlab.com/grappigegovert/localghost/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build_patcher).
2. Open the patcher, and select `ghostmode.rdil.rocks` on the drop-down menu.
3. If this is your first time running the patcher, open Advanced Settings, and untick the box labeled `Use http instead of https`. Then click save.
4. Start HITMANâ„¢ 2, press enter when prompted.
5. You are ready to play Ghost Mode!

You will need to manually invite a friend, as matchmaking is not yet supported.

## Side Notes

-   Peacock and LocalGhost are not the same thing. LocalGhost supports Ghost Mode, and Peacock does not.
-   This Ghost Mode server is run by The Peacock Project team, but _is not Peacock itself_!
