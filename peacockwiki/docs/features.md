## Menus

### Loadouts

- Re-add a required keybind to save loadouts.
- Save starting locations and agency pickups with loadouts.
- Have a way of choosing between individual loadouts or entire sets of loadouts (for full game runners).
- Random loadout generator.

## OpenContracts

- Swap contract creation out for downloading of contracts from official servers (will greatly improve contract accuracy, since our generation algorithm isn't the best).

## Confidence

Coming soon.
